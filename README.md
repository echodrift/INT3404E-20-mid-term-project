# Image Processing: Sino-Nom character localization

## Introduction

This project aims to localize Sino-Nom characters in images using image processing techniques and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.

## Description

The project is structured as follows:

- `data.yaml`: Contains the configuration for the dataset.
- `datasets`: Contains the images and labels for training and validation.
- `run.py`: The main script to augment the dataset.
- `utils`: Contains utility scripts and notebooks for data augmentation and dataset handling.
- `yolo_baseline.py`: The script that implements the YOLO algorithm.

## Result

(TBD: Add a section here describing the results of your project, including any metrics or visualizations.)

## Reproduce

To reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `run.py` script.
(TBD: Add more steps here.)
